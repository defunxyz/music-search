# Music Search Utility

## Motivation
We decided to build an application, using one of the top big and most mentioned JavaScript Frameworks. So, we decided we build something cool and useful. We brainstormed for a while and eventually decided to start building a music player, browser based using the *HTML5 Audio API*. But, as we moved forward, our time constraint caused us to eventually pivot quickly.

Since one of us was leading the way, the decision became quick to move to build an actual search engine like. But be aware this is *not really a* search engine per say. It is rather a utility which hooks up to a few third-party APIs and requests information based on keywords types by the user.

Eventually, we move forward quickly once settled with a new plan in place. And now, you the reader can see what awesome and remarkable web app we’ve built. **Shhh!** There’s still some minor functionality missing, we blame this on “time constraints.”

*P.s. our code is really messy and scary!*

## The Application
This utility is a simple website, with a dark theme, we decided to go with dark because it looks good. It has a search input, a separate component which greets the user depending on time of the day, and a special feature which is the history feature.

P.s.s. Some hints:

* Press **SHIFT + ?** - this will open up a dialog with shortcut-keys
* In an active dialog, press **ESC** to close.

## Technical Decisions


## Addendum
Due to very tough time constraints, there might be some strange behaviour in this utility. However, eventually, in the near feature, unless occupied by some other more important project, we might find time and come back and finish this *perfectly*.
