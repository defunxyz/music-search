# Music Search Utility

## Motivation
We decided to build an application, using one of the top big and most mentioned JavaScript Frameworks. So, we decided we build something cool and useful. We brainstormed for a while and eventually decided to start building a music player, browser based using the *HTML5 Audio API*. But, as we moved forward, our time constraint caused us to eventually pivot quickly.

Since one of us was leading the way, the decision became quick to move to build an actual search engine like. But be aware this is *not really a* search engine per say. It is rather a utility which hooks up to a few third-party APIs and requests information based on keywords types by the user.

Eventually, we move forward quickly once settled with a new plan in place. And now, you the reader can see what awesome and remarkable web app we’ve built. **Shhh!** There’s still some minor functionality missing, we blame this on “time constraints.”

*P.s. our code is really messy and scary!*
